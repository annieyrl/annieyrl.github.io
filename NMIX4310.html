                    <p style="font-size: large">I took this class in Spring 2019. In this course, I was introduced to UIkit with Swift to develop iOS applications using XCode. 
                    Learning a new language and a new IDE is always daunting at first, but I thoroughly enjoyed this class and gained some new insight and skills.
                    We had weekly assignments where we learned about MVC application design, text and image manipulations, API integration, JSON, and more, and finished
                    off with a personalized final assignment to proudly display what we learned. Overall, this class constantly pushed me to ask questions and eventually melted away 
                    my reluctance to ask for help.</p>

                    <h3>Midterm Project</h3>
                    <p style="font-size: large">For my midterm project, I created a bookmark app that allows the user to save the links of their favorite websites in order to access them later. I used a Tableview to organize the links into a list and used a WebVew and segue to display the websites in a new screen. The items in the list can also deleted, as needed, and the changes are saved locally by utilizing the NSMutableData class. 
                                                My main takeaway from this assignment is learning how to save data onto a device and retrieve it.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-5 my-auto">
                    <p style="font-size: large">My final project is a simplified web browser that incorporated the bookmark from the midterm. I used a WebView and set Google as the home page by default and a TextView to create the URL bar. Furthermore, I added a tab bar with four icons connected to four functions: back arrow and forward arrow to traverse through the navigation history, refresh, and bookmark. In addition, when the user opens the bookmarks, the URL of the website currently being displayed is automatically pasted into the url textview.
                                                The process was tricky due to having many components, but the result was very rewarding. My biggest takeaway is learning how to breakdown an idea into smaller, more manageable parts and building up.</p>
