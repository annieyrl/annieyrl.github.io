                    <p style="font-size: large">In Digital Brown Bag, we had weekly seminars with new media industry professionals as guest speakers or a presentation on vital
                    life skills that are typically not taught as college courses. The seminars helped me understand what factors make us stand out among other candidates, 
                    what kinds of questions to ask in an interview, and how to naturally develop career networks. From the presentations, I learned about creating business cards, searching
                    and preparing for a specific job opening, managing credit cards, and understanding the nuances of health insurance. 
                    Although this course did not have projects, I want to share a couple of our interesting assignments.

                    <p style="font-size: large">At the beginning of the semester, every student was required to create a deck of business cards. I learned how to buy and print
                    homemade cards for the first time. Spoiler alert: the result was disastrous due to my inexperience and my uncooperative printer, and I had to get new professionally printed cards.
                    The card that is displayed is from the professionally printed deck.

                    <p style="font-size: large">Regretfully, I will not be sharing my credit score to the World Wide Web. What I will share is that I learned about the importance of credit cards, credit scores,
                    and how to improve or maintain a good credit score. Occasionally, I think about the times when department store cashiers enticed me to create a store credit card (I unfortunately gave in once) 
                    before going to bed at night.</p>
