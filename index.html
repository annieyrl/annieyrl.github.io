                    Computer Science with an emphasis on cybersecurity and certificates in New Media and Applied Data Science. I like exploring new areas in computer science. 
                    So far, I've ventured to software engineering, cloud computing, cybersecurity, machine learning, computer network, and 
                    mobile development. I also like solving puzzles, and I'm good at working with small details. Currently, I am learning the basics of cooking and made my
                    first macaroni and cheese from scratch (excluding the pasta)!</p>

                    <p style="font-size: large">In a team of 4, we used machine learning to see if we can predict the winner of a chess game based on certain features
                    such as the difference in player ratings, whether or not the game affected a player's rating, and the type of opening that was played. We created a Decision Tree model,
                    a Logistic Regression model, a KNN model, and a Naive Bayes model to classify the winner. I specifically worked on the Naive Bayes model, and I used a combination
                    of Bernoulli, Gaussian, and Categorical Naive Bayes models to compute the results. I was able to do this because we can assume that the features are conditionally 
                    independent. The two diagrams above show the proportions of predictions made on the training dataset and the test dataset.

                    <p style="font-size: large">For this assignment, I had to reconstruct faces in a collection of face images by using the Eigenface algorithm, which
                        utilizes the high correlation between face images. In short, I had to center the dataset of face images and perform Principle Component Analysis through
                        Singular Value Decomposition. This is important because the process significantly reduces the computation time that is need to analyze an image with 
                        hundreds of pixels. The result and the centered dataset are used to generate reconstructed face images. The left image displays an example of this process.

                        python binary analysis framework called angr, I wrote a program that was able to explore all of the possible paths and return the user input that lead 
                        to the branch containing "Bingo!" to the console.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: large">For this assignment, I designed and implemented a cloud-based, scalable auto-grader system for introductory programming courses using
                        Amazon Web Service's PaaS support called Elastic Beanstalk to run Docker containers. Specifically, the autograder checks for the accuracy of a submitted
                        c++ program that prompts the user for two names then prints out a sentence that says these two people went on a walk together. To create the autograder,
                        I had to prepare the right environment on a Virtual Machine. Next, I used Python and Flask, a web application framework, to allow users to upload files, grade
                        the submissions, and display the results back to the user. Then, I moved these capabilities to Docker containers. I also had to open some ports to allow communication betweeen network layers, SSH, and Docker.
